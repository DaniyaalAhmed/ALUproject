# ALUproject
Arithmetic logic unit created in Verilog for FPGA: XILINX Nexy A7 100T

## Description
This project was done for a course in Digital Logic Design. Using verilog we were tasked to build
an ALU that would complete computations for binary inputs. This was implemented on the XILINX 
NEXY A7 100T FPGA board and included the following computation for two binary inputs using the 
switches on the board: multiplication, addition, comparison and two's complement subtraction
